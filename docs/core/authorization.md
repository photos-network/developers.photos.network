# Authorization
The Authorization is splitted into two parts.

 1. System permissions
 2. Data permissions

### System permissions
These permissions are used for restrictions used mainly by the core system, e.g.: managing users, change configurations, addon management

### Data permissions
These permissions can be used by addons and are focusing on the data. e.g.: grant access to photos / albums, share via link
