# Details
See all attributes, properties and information for a selected image.

First a user will see only relevant data:

 - tagged faces
 - date/time
 - location
 - image owner (shared by)

Second the user can select something like `all informations` to see more:

 - camera / lens information
 - additional tags
 - exif data (ISO, shutter speed, flash)

This will keep the UI clean and simple but also make all data visible.
