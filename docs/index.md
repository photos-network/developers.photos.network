### Code of conduct

??? quote "Wha is a code of conduct?"
    A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations and behavior for projectâ€™s participants.

To keep a positive social atmosphere in this project, some decicions and requirements have to be applied:

- [x] write beginner friendly code[^1]
- [x] avoid full-stack frameworks[^2]

!!! failure "MvP - Minimum Viable Product"
    After the python PoC the whole project was re-written in Rust. Not all functionality is migrated nor available.


[^1]: Write clean, maintable and well documented code so beginner level programmers can understand it. 
This can increase the willingness of new contributors to join.
[^2]: Full-stack frameworks are great, especially for prototyping and fast development. Often they are coupling components which can lead to a time-consuming development process.
